Seperated movement thread.
	- If we can give each location of a gameobject it's own vertical_movement, then we can have multiple coins moving at the same time. This would benefit the machine_playing() greatly. 
	- In gameobject::move(), we iterate through every location in a for loop and if their vertical_movement value is > 0, decrease it by speed.
	- How can we go about this? options:
		1) create an std::vector<float> where we have a parallel set of values for std::vector locations.
		CONS: indexes could get out of wack having two seperate lists.
		2) the std::vector locations could be a vector of some struct that includes a glm::vec3 and that pieces' vertical_movement.
		CONS: the locations vector is used in many places, but not all of them would have to be changed. For example, if a line of code is trying to get the .size(), then nothing needs to be changed.

Selection Delay.
	- Need to figure out why there is some delay in the coin visually moving (the vertical_movment is still being changed). 
	- My guess is draw() isn't being called due to minimax calculations but the movement thread is working. Maybe lock the mutex? Can test on my better computer.
